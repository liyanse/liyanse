### About me!
---
Hello üëã
 </br>
I'm Data Analyst with crazy interest in Machine Learning.
 Who am I kidding, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer
 I am obsessed with deriving better solutions from data, especially computer vision models.
 Welcome to my small world where I show you some of the solutions I have worked on with data.

 I am currently participating in Open Source contributions with teams like UnifyAI.
 Other than my professional work, I love talking about working in freelancing in Data Science. The year is 2023, we've all learnt how easily life could pass us by and we
 all love and appreciate working with our own schedules. So follow me on my socials to learn more about this.
</p>
 - ‚ö° Fun fact: I love playing board games and wild photography üòÑIf I could, I'd love to work as a Machine Learning Engineer for Formula 1. (And yes, I love watching F1, take a guess at what team I support)
 </p>
 - Don't be afraid to launch a product without machine learning
 
 - If you torture your data long enough, it will confess to anything
</br>


### üõ†Ô∏è: Skills:
- **Proficient:** Python, Computer Vision(YOLOv), OpenAI, Machine Learning
- **Moderate:** SQL, PowerBi
- **Database:** SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL
